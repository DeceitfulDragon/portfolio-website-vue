    "about": "My biggest render by far, made up of some reused models but many new ones! As my third fallout project, I went with a red rocket garage turned into a power armor garage in this fictional settlement. Much of the models are my own, but I didn't finish the render by my set deadline so I used the power armor models from the game files. This was an 8K render so it also took longer than the rest, with a goal to eventually animate the garage door opening and closing.",

    "about": "My second fallout project, meant to be a watchtower-turned-home on the outskirts of whatever settlement the first render is from. I reused some of my previous models while also experimenting with new things like the fire and smoke simulation in the background (There's a tent made with an overturned car behind it.) There's also some lore written on the pages hanging by the terminal. Most of the models and textures done by me, but I did use some Fallout 4 textures for things like the poster and notes.",

    "about": "A small render I made while learning how to use Blender. All models made by me, using references from Fallout 4. Some textures (like the posters) were taken from the game files. Took about a week of on-and-off rendering (about 8 hour sessions each) to get the look I wanted. Actual modelling was likely around a month or two.
